        <p> This is a picture of campus, taken by a radio-controlled Airplane. It is actually cropped because the original 
        was over half sky and trees. 
        You  may click on this picture to see the original. </p>
        
        <img src="quality10.jpg" height="182" width="600" /></a>
        <p> This is a copy of that picture, saved as a .jpg with a quality of 10. The trees have become smudges and many details are foggy.  </p>
        
        <img src="120x120.jpg" height="120" width="120" /></a> <p> This is the better version of this picture, only we have distorted it by making it appear as 120x120. </p>
