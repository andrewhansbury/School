          <h2>Diffusion of Innovations</h2>
          <p>
            The path of innovation is not a smooth uphill climb. At the point of
            adoption, the value of an innovation is negative. At this point cost
            has been incurred for scanning, selection, and commitment (Rogers
            2003, p. 14). But no benefit has yet resulted. Positive value
            derives only from actual use pursuant to the mission of the
            individual or organization.
          </p>
          <p>
            At implementation time, alignment between the innovation and the
            individual or organization may be poor. Examples of poor alignment
            include:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              A cumbersome interface between the individual and the technology,
              resulting in confusion or additional work to accomplish the job.
            </li>
            <li>
              Lack of knowledge about how to use the technology efficiently,
              resulting in reduced efficiency.
            </li>
            <li>
              A technology whose product is not what the organization needs,
              resulting either in failure to accomplish the mission or reduced
              efficiency.
            </li>
            <li>
              Increased workload due to parallel runs of old and new systems.
            </li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            Adjusting alignment for maximum effect may involve changes in the
            innovation, changes in its use, changes in understanding of the
            innovation, or even changes in the organization's mission. This
            process of adjustment is, due to its multidimensional nature,
            necessarily &quot;messy&quot; and difficult to study. Yet it is a
            critical part of deriving benefit from innovations.
          </p>
          <p>
            While numerous research studies have considered initial adoption and
            implementation of new technologies, they usually treat each
            technology as a discrete entity unrelated to previous technologies
            used. This is best indicated by the fact that they fail to specify
            the technology being replaced. However, innovations do not exist in
            a vacuum. Innovations are usually adaptations or extensions of
            existing technology. They are likely to be invoked in an atmosphere
            involving substantial existing technology. Rogers (2003, p. 15)
            suggests that it is appropriate to do research which takes existing
            technology into account. Accordingly, this research focuses on a
            change from one version of a technology to another: a software
            system upgrade.
