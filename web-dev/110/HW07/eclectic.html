          <h2>Eclectic Models</h2>
          <p>TAM-TTF</p>
          <p>
            Dishaw and Strong (1999) saw overlap between TAM and TTF, and
            created a combined model called the TAM-TTF. The combined model had
            more predictive power than TAM alone. They note significantly that
            while TAM is a mature theory, TTF was still undergoing evolution and
            as such the TTF constructs they used should be considered tentative.
          </p>
          <p>"Decomposed" TPB</p>
          <p>
            Taylor and Todd (1995b) "decomposed" TPB by using constructs from
            Rogers (1995). They then compared TPB, the "decomposed" TPB, and TAM
            (Davis, 1989). They found TAM to explain 34% of behavior, TPB to
            explain 34% of behavior, and "decomposed" TPB to explain a
            "moderate" increase of 36%. Their conclusion was that additional
            factors were far more significant, and situation-specific.
          </p>

          <p>TAM2</p>
          <p>
            Venkatesh and Davis (2000) studied TAM with additional constructs
            (Subjective Norm, Experience, Image, Job Relevance, Output Quality,
            and Result Demonstrability) to explain Perceived Usefulness, in four
            longitudinal studies. They found Subjective Norm consistently lost
            impact as experience grew. Perceived usefulness was impacted
            directly by Subjective Norm, Image, Job Relevance, and Result
            Demonstrability. Experience negatively moderated Subjective Norm,
            and Output Quality positively moderated Job Relevance. Subjective
            Norm impacted Intention to Use, but Intention to Use explained only
            52% of variation in Usage Behavior.
