          <h2>Original Models</h2>

          <p>
            Through five editions of his book by that name, Rogers (1962, 1971,
            1983, 1995, 2003) has promoted and traced a thread of research based
            on five fundamental factors he terms Perceived Characteristics of
            Innovations (PCIs), and which he posits are key to understanding
            adoption decisions. He describes them thus in the introduction to
            his book:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              Relative Advantage - The degree to which an innovation is
              perceived as better than the idea it supersedes.
            </li>
            <li>
              Compatibility - The degree with which an innovation is perceived
              as being consistent with the existing values, past experiences,
              and needs of potential adopters.
            </li>
            <li>
              Complexity - The degree to which an innovation is perceived as
              difficult to understand and use.
            </li>
            <li>
              Trialability - The degree to which an innovation may be
              experimented with on a limited basis.
            </li>
            <li>
              Observability - The degree to which the results of an innovation
              are visible to others.
            </li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            These five constructs were developed in studies of agricultural
            innovations, but have had some difficulty being applied to
            Information Technology. Numerous efforts have been made (Agarwal
            &amp; Prasad, 1997; Moore &amp; Benbasat, 1991; Venkatesh et al.,
            2003) to adjust the list of PCIs to give more predictive power to
            the model. Rogers' theory is highly pervasive in the literature, and
            few papers attempt to explain adoption or diffusion theory without
            relating to DOI. <br />
            In time, DOI as applied to Information Technology adoption by
            individuals, has added the constructs of Image and Volunteerism
            (Agarwal &amp; Prasad, 1997).
          </p>
          <p>
            Theory of Reasoned Action (TRA) and Theory of Planned Behavior (TPB)
          </p>
          <p>
            Icek Ajzen and colleagues have developed the TRA (which morphed into
            the TPB) over the years. This concept is a mathematical expression
            of long-standing approach of assigning values to various perceptions
            in an attempt to explain how people make decisions. As stated by
            Fishbein and Ajzen (1975, p. 29), the TRA states that:
          </p>
          <blockquote>
            &quot;... a person's attitude toward any object is a function of his
            beliefs about the object and the implicit evaluation responses
            associated with those beliefs. The central equation of the theory
            can be expressed as follows:<br />
            <img
              width="76"
              height="45"
              src="images/original_clip_image003.gif"
              alt="equation"
            /><br />
            where <em>A0</em> is the attitude toward some object, <em>O</em>;
            <em>bi</em> is the belief <em>i</em> about <em>O</em>, i. e., the
            subjective probability that <em>O</em> is related to attribute
            <em>i</em>; <em>ei</em> is the evaluation of attribute <em>i</em>;
            and <em>n</em> is the number of beliefs.&quot;
          </blockquote>
          <p>
            TPB (Ajzen, 1985, 1991) extends the theory so that it &quot;takes
            into account perceived as well as actual control over the behavior
            under consideration&quot; (Ajzen, 1985).
          </p>
          <p>
            Connor and Armitage (1998), however, showed evidence that TPB was
            hardly definitive and needed additional constructs.
          </p>
          <p>Technology Acceptance Model (TAM)</p>
          <p>
            The Technology Acceptance Model (TAM) was proposed by Davis (1989)
            as having extreme simplicity, yet strong predictive power. Adams,
            Nelson, and Todd (1992) replicated the initial research, but
            concluded that it only explained about a third of the total
            variation. Perceived Ease of Use (PEOU) and Perceived Usefulness
            (PU) were found to predict Intention to Use (ITU). Various studies
            have shown different coefficients for PEOU and PU, and Venkatesh
            (2000) suggested determined that this may be due to a shift from
            PEOU in early days of a technology, to PU once it becomes
            routinized. Davis, Bogozzi, and Warshaw (1989) obtained similar
            results, showing PEOU dropping in its importance with experience. In
            a separate study Davis (1989), suggested that &quot;perceived ease
            of use may be casual antecedent to perceived usefulness.&quot; In a
            replication, Hu et al. (1999) discovered that higher-level
            professionals are less likely to be affected by PEOU, suggesting
            that the shift from PEOU to PU may relate to self-efficacy which is
            likely to grow over a longer period of time in less-intelligent
            users.
          </p>
          <p>
            Numerous studies (Agarwal &amp; Karahanna, 2000; Agarwal &amp;
            Prasad, 2000; Dishaw &amp; Strong, 1999; Mathieson, Peacock, &amp;
            Chin, 2001; Moore &amp; Benbasat, 1990; Rawstorne, Jayasuriya, &amp;
            Caputi, 2000; Taylor &amp; Todd, 1995b) have attempted to connect
            TAM to other theories in hopes of increasing explanatory power by
            various combinations, or contrast TAM with other theories (Davis,
            1989).
          </p>
          <p>
            Gefen and Straub (1997) considered a different aspect: gender
            differences. They found that women differ from men in their
            expectations of new technology, but actual use is the same.
          </p>
          <p>
            Ginzberg (1981) discovered a link between realistic expectations and
            happiness with the application, suggesting that expectation
            management is a significant component of perceived system success.
            Oliver (1980) obtained similar results.

          <p>Model of Personal Computer Utilization MPCU</p>
          <p>
            The Model of Personal Computer Utilization (MPCU) theory of
            Thompson, Higgins, and Howell (1991, 1994), based on a model
            proposed by Triandis (1980), considers factors which influence
            Intention to Use, thus indirectly influencing actual use. The
            factors in their first study (Thompson, Higgins, &amp; Howell 1991)
            are: Social Norm, Affect, Complexity (considered an obstacle), Job
            Fit, Long-Term Consequences, and Facilitating Conditions. Their 1994
            study (Thompson, Higgins, &amp; Howell, 1994) added Experience to
            the model.
          </p>
          <p>Computer Self-Efficacy Model (CSE)</p>
          <p>
            Howard and Mendelow (1991) confirmed the intuitive connection
            between computer literacy and choice to use computers. Compeau and
            Higgens (1995a) refined this concept by researching the effect of
            peoples' <em>perception</em> of their ability to use computers and
            its effect on their <em>actual success</em> in using computers. In
            an extension of this research (Compeau, Higgens, &amp; Huff, 1999),
            their hypothesis of a positive relationship was validated and
            extended to a wider group of subjects. A separate study by the same
            authors (Compeau &amp; Higgens, 1995b) found that with further
            experience the effect of CSE on performance became less. Later
            studies have considered the effect of habit and affect (mood).
            Verplanken, Aarts, and Van Knippenberg (1996) showed habit to affect
            choices significantly, but Bamberg, Ajzen, and Schmidt (2003)
            discounted habit, while Limayem, Cheung, and Chan (2003) found it to
            be a moderator between other factors and ITU. Limayem and Hirt
            (2003)Â saw habit as a construct that increased TAM's explanatory
            power.
          </p>
          <p>Task-Technology Fit Model (TTF)</p>
          <p>
            TTF theory considers to study alignment between IT and needs
            (Goodhue &amp; Thompson, 1995; Goodhue, 1995) This study was
            replicated and the model validated by Dishaw and Strong (1998) in a
            software maintenance environment. While Goodhue and Thompson (1995)
            did not show explanatory power in TTF, they suggested that, &quot;A
            more compelling interpretation is that in this case the causal
            effect works in the other direction...For example, perhaps
            individuals who use the systems a great deal and are very dependent
            on them will be more frustrated by problems. ...the quality of the
            data, production timeliness, and relationship with IS all predicted
            higher perceived impact of information systems, beyond what could be
            predicted by utilization alone.&quot;
          </p>
          <p>
            Mark Dishaw and his colleagues have produced a series of articles
            relating TTF to other theories. Dishaw and Strong (1999) determined
            that a combined TAM/TTF model produces better predictions that TAM
            alone. Dishaw, Strong, and Bandy (2004) proposed testing a
            combination of TTF and the Unified Theory of Acceptance and Use of
            Technology (UTAUT).
          </p>
          <p>
            In the end, TAM may not be a viable alternative to DOI. Plouffe,
            Hulland, and Vandenbosch, (2001) compared TAM to DOI, concluding
            that DOI was had better parsimony and explained more variation in
            ITU.
