<td ><h2>Tangential Theories &amp; Constructs</h2>
  <p>Success Factors Theory</p>
  <p>Ely (1990) notes that adoption yields nothing of value to  the organization, but reaping advantages of an innovation is an entirely  different act - probably performed by an entirely different group of people.  Gersick (1991) treated the other side of the coin, suggesting  that significant changes can be highly disruptive. As an alternative to  theories which focus on perceptions, Ely (1990, 1999) cites a number of important  success factors in implementation. These are described below in terms of a  technology innovation in the Solomon Islands (Chand et al., 2005) where rural subsistence farmers have been successfully equipped with email. </p>
  <ol>
    <li>Dissatisfaction with the status quo. The people served  by the project were isolated from friends and relatives, and travel by  available means (usually hand-paddled canoes) was time-consuming and fatiguing. </li>
    <li>Existence of knowledge and skills. From each village to  be served, a volunteer operator was selected and trained at a central site. </li>
    <li>Availability of resources. A tapestry of government grants provided equipment for each site and infrastructure. The system uses  shortwave radios to communicate, and the remote sites use photovoltaic energy  sources to make them autonomous. </li>
    <li>Availability of time. Surprisingly, this has proved a  constraint. Kaitu'u (personal communication via email, February 17, 2006), a  station operator, expressed consternation with expectations that he spend much  time he needs to be cultivating crops, transmitting and receiving email for a the  local equivalent of $27 US per month - far from enough to make up for the cost  to his farming activity. A cognate problem is cultural concepts of time: At  some stations the local operator has not kept the schedule as posted, leading  to frustration among users (Chand et al., 2005, p. 49) . </li>
    <li>Rewards or incentives exist. Simply being able to communicate with a several-hour turnaround instead of days or weeks of travel,  is sufficient incentive for users. For the operator, the fees paid by users  form an incentive (although it is not enough to really be worth his while as  stated above). </li>
    <li>Participation. Once a few people tried the system and  discovered it worked, more came on board until it because a routine part of  life in the community. The facilitative efforts of operators helped, since  communication did not require active participation of email receivers. </li>
    <li>Commitment. Reliable access to the system is important.  The operator considers his service to be an important community asset. The  computer used has &quot;died&quot; once, and was out of commission for some weeks as a  result. The community having no alternatives, simply had to be patient. </li>
    <li>Leadership. The central site at the capital is  well-organized and its leaders have managed to transcend political upheaval in  the country. </li>
  </ol>

  <p>Habit</a> Construct</p>
  <p>Limayem and Hirt (2003) and Limayem, Hirt, and Chin (2001) studied the effects of habit on IT usage,  concluding that habit moderates the link between intention to use and actual  usage. A person who has actually used a specific behavior is more likely to  carry forth their reasoned decision to use it in the future. Verplanken, Aarts,  and Van Knippenberg (1996) found that habit had a strong influence on  behavior for routine activities. Oulette and Wood (1998) went a step further, asserting that  application of rational thinking to behavior is less likely in routine  situations - meaning that if you wish someone to think, you should set up circumstances  that they will perceive as unusual. They divide such circumstances into  rarely-performed behaviors, and choices made in the face of uncertainty. Ajzen  (2002) cautioned, however, that habit is difficult to  measure because one may actually be measuring <em>previous</em> decisions. </p>
  
 <p>Adaptive  Structuration Theory</p>
  
  <p>A major challenge for diffusion  study is the complexity of life. There is a dynamic relationship between  various actors involved in diffusion. DeSanctis and Poole  (1994) describe this view as Adaptive Structuration  Theory (AST). Creators of technology may adapt it as they discover needs for an  improved fit between the technology and targeted users. The users may adapt the  technology (Morrison, Roberts, &amp; Hippel, 2000) or use it in unanticipated ways (e.  g. a monkey climbing a stick before it falls over to reach a banana hung from  the ceiling, rather than using the stick to knock the banana down). Or, new  technology can impact culture directly. As stated by DeSanctis and Poole (1994):</p>
  <p>
    Change occurs as members of  organizational groups bring the structural potential of these new technologies  into interaction, appropriating available structures during the course of idea  generation, conflict management, and other group decision activities. </p>
  <p>
    This researcher experienced AST when  performing the simple task of moving an email server. Careful planning reduced  the downtime to less than ten minutes. The process was interrupted and slightly  lengthened by a demand (issued while the server was being rolled down the hall)  that the system be switched back on instantly so that payroll could be run. The  person who was responsible for signing off on minor exceptions to payroll  policy had within two years switched from avoiding all direct computer use, to  near-total dependence on email for an essential step in the organization's  processes. The idea of using paper to establish a trail for those decisions had  not only become secondary, it had vanished. This stage is termed  &quot;routinization&quot; by Rogers  (2003, p. 428) . </p>
  <p>Compatibility and Connectedness Constructs</p>
    <p>
    New technologies, if radical, can  suffer initially from a lack of connectedness with existing technologies. Rogers  (2003, p. 15) uses the construct Compatibility to describe  this dimension. Hiltz and Turoff (1981), for instance, studied email in an  early incarnation. Their research determined that users wanted &quot;group  conferences, notebooks for text composition, and self-defined commands.&quot; The  universal connectivity considered foundational 25 years later was a distant  dream. </p>
  <p>
    A related issue is competing  technologies that have similar value. Kraut et al. (1998) describe such a  situation, with two video-telephone systems which were introduced into a  company simultaneously. In time one of them prevailed and the other withered -  for no particular reason other than chance. This was a simple case in which the  two systems were incompatible. If they had been partially compatible (able to  communicate cross-system, but with somewhat reduced capability), one may safely  assume that the results would have been murky from a research standpoint. </p>
  <p>
    Thus the issue of compatibility  confounds researchers. This phenomenon may illuminate the analysis of Igbaria,  Parasuraman, and Baroundi (1996),  who were unable to identify any construct that explained a major portion of  usage variation. </p>
  Verplanken, Aarts, and Van  Knippenberg. (1996) showed that habit injects a  non-rational element that should be accounted for. Seemingly to the contrary, Davis, Bogozzi, and Warshaw (1989)Â compared TRA with TAM,  determining that Behavioral Intention is a filter through which  one's thoughts must pass before action occurs. </p></td>
