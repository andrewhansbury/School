          <h2>Gallivan's Perspective</h2>
          <p>
            Gallivan (2001), in a non-empirical paper, encapsulated the entire
            concept of perceptions and decisions in a framework based on
            organizational politics. He described adoption as being two (or
            more) phases. The first phase involves the search for and selection
            of a technology to meet a business problem. The second phase
            involves the subsequent implementation and use. He made the point
            that for each level at which a decision is made, the phases of
            adoption and implementation apply. At high levels, implementation
            consists of passing the innovation to the next lower level. At lower
            levels, adoption means acceptance of what is passed down from above.
            At the final level where it is brought to bear on the organization's
            needs, implementation means making it actually work.
          </p>
          <p>
            Gallivan (2001) suggests that authoritarian structures influence
            early stages in the process, but not necessarily latter stages. By
            extension, one might posit that an adoption decision has a limited
            ability to penetrate down the organization chart - suggesting a
            reason why large organizations may appear unwieldy.
          </p>
          <p>
            Rawstorne, Jayasuriya, and Caputi (1998) note a different between
            what they term &quot;symbolic adoption&quot; and &quot;actual
            adoption&quot; which map to the primary and secondary adoption
            phases of Gallivan (2001).
          </p>
          <p>
            Interestingly, Gallivan (2001) did not in his politically-schemed
            framework consider the possibility that an innovation might come to
            an implementer from a source other than above:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>Freely downloadable from the Internet</li>
            <li>Self-purchase by individuals from an outside source</li>
            <li>Illegal copying from an outside source</li>
            <li>Open-source</li>
            <li>Creation within the organization</li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            An alternative view was suggested by Surry and Ensminger (2003), who
            validated Ely's (1990) model in the Education domain using eight
            conditions: Dissatisfaction, Skills, Resources, Time, Rewards,
            Participation, Commitment, and Leadership; in lieu of Rogers' (2003)
            PCIs.
