          <h2>Unified Models</h2>

          <p>
            Attempts have been made to unify the various theory streams, as
            combinations lost parsimony. Perhaps most notable so far is UTAUT.
          </p>
          <p>UTAUT</p>
          <p>
            Venkatesh et al. (2003) gathered constructs from TAM, CSE, TRA/TPB,
            MCPI, and IDT to formulate the Unified Theory of Acceptance and Use
            of Technology (UTAUT). They concluded that different groups of
            people fit different models, and that a single model did not explain
            variation in behavior well.
          </p>

          <p>TTF-UTAUT</p>
          <p>
            In yet another attempt to create a comprehensive model, Dishaw,
            Strong, and Bandy (2004) suggested adding TTF constructs to UTAUT.
            As of this writing, their results have not been published.
